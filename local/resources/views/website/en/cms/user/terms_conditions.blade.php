                       When you request to lease a rental item from a Lessor through Mustajarati, you accept and agree that you are entering into a contractual transaction to conclude a legally binding agreement with the relevant Lessor - not with Mustajarati. You represent that there may be potential direct or indirect risks resulting from leasing the items offered by the Lessor on the platform - including but not limited to, loss or damage of the rental items. You assume all potential risks relating to this process. You undertake to compensate the Lessor for any damage that may be caused to their rental item, whether it is partial damage, by estimating the damage by a technician agreed upon by both parties, or compensate for the entire market value of the item if the item is lost or damaged and can’t be repaired.

                        You expressly agree, without limiting any other term of these Terms that Mustajarati is not a party to this contractual transaction and is not obligated to resolve disputes between the parties or provide solutions to them. Rather, it reserves the right to monitor its services to prevent violations of these Terms and misuse of the Service.

                       You may not engage in any practice or method that reduces or evades Mustajarati’s Commission that would have been paid if the contractual transaction had been completed using Mustajarati. (These practices are collectively referred to as "Commission Evasion"). Commission evasion includes, but not limited to, initiating any contractual transaction on the platform and then coordinating in another way to rent or lease the rental items outside Mustajarati, setting a zero value or pricing the item at a very low amount on the platform. If any user engages in any of these commission evasions, such user(s) shall indemnify and hold Mustajarati harmless from and against any losses incurred as a result of the commission evasion. If you attempt to engage any user you met through Mustajarati to complete a rental process to avoid using Mustajarati Service, you are liable to pay a fine of up to three hundred riyals (SAR 300) as a fine, or Mustajarati will terminate your account without any liability to you.
